## ABSTRACT (Diagrams Paper)
How does one visually represent the use of time? We explored students’ use of graphical metaphors by asking undergraduates at a public French university to generate representations of their personal time- use including: activities, sequence, duration, timing, and frequency. The resulting use of space and form was analyzed by way of an iteratively developed coding scheme. We discuss how the analyses of the sponta- neous productions support previous research on spatial representations of time, and the implications for the design of time management tools for students.

## ABSTRACT (Project Paper)
It is by the nature of existence that human activity exists in both space and time.  While  it is possible for the researcher to examine activity in isolation, and similarly to consider  human movement through space without regard to time, in doing so, the researcher  risks overlooking puissant relations between these elemental constructs.  By accounting  for each dimension, time>geography provides an effective approach for examining the  use of time in everyday life.  In this paper we present a research model for psychological  inquiries based on time use data and the time>geographic perspective.  We start by  reviewing the history of psychological research on the construct of time, as summarized  by Hancock & Block in 2012.  We differentiate between time perception and experience  of time, and argue for a pragmatic but explicit consideration of time by investigators of  human behavior.  We then present an overview of time use research in the sociological  and economic traditions and provide examples for how the study of time allocation may  be used to explore psychological phenomena. Finally, the time>geographic perspective  (Hägerstrand, 1989) is presented as a conceptual framework for psychological  exploration of time use, and two possible lines of research are discussed to exemplify its  application.
